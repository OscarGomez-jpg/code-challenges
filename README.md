# code-challenges

This repo was created to have fun with diverse and interesting challenges using
the macroquad crate.

However, I want to make an honorific mention to
[The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) YouTube channel as
it is the place where I get most of the ideas.

Any of this codes can be runned by positioning on the folder of the desire project
and typing `cargo run` (Rust lang must be installed before!)
